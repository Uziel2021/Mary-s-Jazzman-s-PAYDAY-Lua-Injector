Installation:
	(Replacing Pirate Perfection's hook)
		-> Remove IPHLPAPI.dll from your root game folder (Usually located here: C:\...\Steam\steamapps\common\PAYDAY 2)
		-> Copy lightfx.dll and light_hook.ini to root game folder
		(Optional step, you're probably want to skip it)
		-> Place __require2.lua in root game folder and open init.lua. Replace all __require.lua strings with __require2.lua.
	Enjoy your freedom to modify everything :)
	
	(Developer's way)
		-> Copy lightfx.dll, light_hook.ini, init.lua and __require2.lua to game folder
		-> Study init.lua & __require2.lua comments and start implementing your lua stuff.
		   You you probably need to add your callbacks to __require table.
		   Add callbacks to '/lib/entry' if you don' know from what to start. This will call your function after all requires happened.
		-> Start game and test if your stuff work.
		
Compilation (W.I.P.):
	TO DO: Explain compilation process properly, verify info
	(Windows)
	-> Install this: https://cygwin.com/install.html
	-> During installation, search for mingw packages, install x86 ones.
	-> Append cygwin/bin folder to %PATH% variable. (Use path cmd or do this in "My Computer" settings)
	-> Launch compile.bat
	-> Binary should appear in same folder as you build
	-> Enjoy your modified DLL if this did work for you
	If you know better way to do this, you're welcome to contribute.
	
	(GNU/Linux)
	It is going to compile DLL for windows. I suspect you're using wine to play PAYDAY 2.
	-> Install mingw-w64-gcc (or just mingw, depends on OS)
	-> Navigate to folder with source code
	-> i686-w64-mingw32-gcc -shared -c  *.c -s -O2 && i686-w64-mingw32-gcc -shared -o stuff/lightfx.dll  *.o -s -O2 -Wl,--kill-at
	-> If it didn't work, try looking into i686-w64-mingw32-gcc manual for solution, sorry about that mess.
